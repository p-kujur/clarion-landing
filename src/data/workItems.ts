    longDescription:
      "One of Clarion's most widely recognised interventions has been the development of ultra-affordable school notebooks priced at ₹5, at a time when comparable notebooks in the market cost ₹25-₹30. We redesigned the entire notebook value chain — from paper quality to printing scale. IEC and social messaging was integrated on notebook covers and selected inner pages. Notebooks became a learning and awareness medium beyond school hours, engaging parents and guardians. Advertising by government departments, CSR programmes, and NGOs helped subsidise production costs.",
